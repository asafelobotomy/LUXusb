## Archive Policy

Documents are moved to the archive when:
1. Implementation is complete and stable
2. The document represents a historical snapshot rather than current state
3. The information is superseded by newer documentation
4. The document is primarily for historical reference

Active documentation remains in `docs/` and is kept up-to-date with current implementation.
